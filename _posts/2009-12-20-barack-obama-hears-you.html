				<h3>What it Was</h3>
				<p class="first">
					This is the second in a series of pieces analyzing what people on Twitter are saying to or about
					United States President, Barack Obama (<em><a href="http://twitter.com/BarackObama">@BarackObama</a></em> on Twitter.) As new messages are 
					displayed, the image of President Obama shows a slight emotional reaction based upon
					that message's emotional valence which is calculated by analyzing Tweets with the
					<a href="http://jessefulton.com/playground/emote-api">EmoTe API</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pairing Shepard Fairey's iconic imagery with
					the wide variety of commentary coming from Twitter creates some interesting 
					juxtapositions. The <a href="http://jessefulton.com/playground/emote-api">EmoTe API</a> also
					has trouble dealing with certain language, especially "internet shorthand"
					and sarcasm. Occasionally, this causes the animated Obama to behave differently than expected,
					causing you to rethink what you really know about <em>@BarackObama</em>.
